1) The "PopandGDPjoin" code file is written in python's pandas library and is an example of taking two dataframes (population_and_demography.csv and gdp.csv), manipulating, cleaning, and joining the data into one dataframe for easier analysis.
2) The next project "Regression of Insurance Data" is a multiple linear regression model using sklearn, some plotting with the results using matplotlib, and some further options for python analysis of the data/regression results. all of the print statements are hashed to avoid the console from being flooded with print statements of various data
3) The "GDP and POP.pbix" Power BI file is a visualization and analysis of the resultant data from the population and GDP data
4) The "GDP and Pop.pdf" pdf file holds the visualizations from the Power BI file in case the Power BI program is not accessible to the viewer
5) The last file "Partial Dependence Plot Insurance" is further plotting with matplotlib of the insurance.csv data.
6) The three .csv files are input data for the code for reference
